# TMXExtracter
NFS TMX Extracter: By RaTT

This script takes in engine sound TMX files from NFS games and extracts every GIN and TMX file from them.
Unfortunately, the extraction may not be perfect, as this doesn't account for random padding bytes that may appear at the end of each file.

To use this, simply drag the TMX files you want extracted into the script.
